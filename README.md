This project is a classic implementation of the popular Snake Game in Java, showcasing fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and graphical user interface development. The game features a snake that dynamically grows as it consumes food items, challenging the player to navigate and avoid collisions with the game boundaries and the snake's own body. The graphical interface is built using Java's Swing library, providing an interactive and engaging gaming experience. Feel free to explore the source code, contribute, or use it as a learning resource for Java programming and game development.
